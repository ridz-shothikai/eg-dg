<h1>Preliminary Design Report - Project: Renovation and Furnishing of Building "A"</h1>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 26, 2023</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) summarizes the key architectural design elements for the "Renovation and Furnishing of Building 'A'" project, located in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, for the African Union Commission (AUC). This report is based on OCR-extracted text from architectural floor plans, elevations, and schedules provided in the diagrams. This report will outline the key components, dimensions, materials, and specifications gleaned from the OCR data. Given the nature of OCR data, some interpretations and generalizations are necessary.</p>

<h2>2. System Overview</h2>

<p>The project involves the renovation and furnishing of an existing building with multiple floors, including basement levels and a roof. The architectural drawings provide floor plans for the ground floor, first through ninth floors (derived from elevator elevations), and basement floors. The primary focus appears to be on interior renovations, including modifications to office spaces, corridors, toilet facilities, and pool office areas. The building includes designated spaces such as offices for the Deputy Director, Director, Secretaries, meeting rooms, and general staff offices. The design drawings also include details pertaining to window and door types. The scale used in the floor plans is 1:100.</p>
