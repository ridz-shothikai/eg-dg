# Project Brief: Engineering Insights

## 1. Product Overview

Engineering Insights is an AI-powered engineering platform for interpreting and analyzing technical diagrams such as blueprints, P&IDs, bridge drawings, and structural schematics. It utilizes Google Cloud Vision for OCR and Gemini 2.0 for natural language processing to extract insights like Bill of Materials (BoM), code compliance checks, diagram comparisons, and enables users to chat in plain English with uploaded diagrams.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- Automate extraction of engineering insights from technical diagrams
- Allow natural language querying of documents using Gemini 2.0
- Enable BoM and BoQ generation with full metadata
- Support compliance checks against IBC, Eurocodes, and IS standards
- Provide version control and change detection between diagram revisions
- Integrate with tools like AutoCAD, Google Drive, Jira
