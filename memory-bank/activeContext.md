# Active Context: UI Refinements & Report Implementation

**Date:** March 28, 2025

**Status:** Refining UI elements and continuing report generation implementation.

**Recent Activity:**
- **Report Generation (OCR/PDR):** Successfully implemented and debugged OCR/PDR report generation using SSE for real-time feedback. This includes:
    - Local file caching workflow (upload to `/temp`, sync on load, read from `/temp`).
    - SSE API route (`ocr/route.js`) sending status updates and final signed GCS URL for temporary PDF.
    - Frontend SSE handling (`ProjectDetailPage`) displaying status on button and opening PDF in new tab.
    - Addressed GCS auth, path extraction, PDF encoding, Gemini safety, and Gemini payload errors.
    - Masked backend errors from UI.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Increased font size of "Eng Diagram Insight" title in Sidebar.
    - Removed "Sign Up" button from the main landing page (`/`).
    - Replaced "Sign Up" link on Login page (`/login`) with static text "Don't have an account? Contact with us".
    - Adjusted loading state on report buttons for better visual feedback.
- **Report Generation (BoM):**
    - Created BoM report API route (`bom/route.js`) using SSE pattern.
    - Implemented frontend handler (`handleBomDownload`) and state management for BoM button.

**Current Focus:**
- Implementing the "Compliance Download" report feature using the established SSE pattern.
- Testing all report download functionalities.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Implement the "Compliance Download" report generation API (using SSE) and frontend logic.
2.  Thoroughly test OCR, BoM, and Compliance report downloads.
3.  Refine PDF formatting in the report generation API routes.
4.  Continue with Phase 7 tasks (Testing, CI/CD, etc.) once report features are stable.
5.  Address potential multiple file upload improvements.
