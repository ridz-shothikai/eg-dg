# Active Context: Report Generation Implementation & Debugging

**Date:** March 28, 2025

**Status:** Successfully implemented OCR/PDR report generation with real-time feedback.

**Recent Activity:**
- Updated chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]/route.js`) to use `gemini-2.0-flash`.
- Added `react-markdown` library for chat response rendering.
- Fixed chat UI layout issues for independent scrolling.
- Replaced report download buttons with "OCR Download", "BoM Download", "Compliance Download".
- Added `cursor-pointer` style to download buttons.
- Created OCR report API endpoint (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/ocr/route.js`).
- Installed `pdf-lib` and `@google-cloud/storage`.
- **Implemented Local File Caching Workflow:**
    - Modified Upload API (`/api/upload`) to save copies to `/temp/`.
    - Created Sync API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/sync-files`) to download missing files from GCS to `/temp/` on project load.
    - Modified Project Detail page (`/project/[projectId]`) to call Sync API.
    - Modified Chat API (`/api/chat`) and OCR Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/ocr`) to read files from `/temp/` instead of GCS/File API.
    - Removed immediate temp file cleanup from OCR Report API (assuming external cleanup).
- **Implemented SSE for OCR Report:**
    - Refactored OCR Report API (`ocr/route.js`) to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) via a `GET` request.
    - API now sends status updates (`message` event), the final download URL (`complete` event), or errors (`error` event).
    - Generated PDF is uploaded temporarily to GCS, and a signed URL is sent via SSE.
    - Updated frontend (`ProjectDetailPage`) to use `EventSource` to connect, display status messages on the button, and open the download URL in a new tab (`window.open`).
- **Addressed OCR Report API Errors:**
    - Fixed GCS authentication by using `sa.json` keyfile.
    - Fixed GCS object path extraction from `storagePath`.
    - Fixed PDF generation error (`WinAnsi cannot encode`) by handling newlines.
    - Fixed Gemini `RECITATION` block by applying relaxed safety settings to the OCR step.
    - Fixed Gemini `400 Bad Request` by correcting the payload structure for `generateContent`.
    - Masked detailed backend errors from the frontend, showing a generic message.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Adjusted loading state on the "OCR Download" button to show spinner and status text inline.

**Current Focus:**
- Implementing the "BoM Download" and "Compliance Download" report features, likely using a similar SSE approach.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Implement the "BoM Download" report generation API (using SSE) and frontend logic.
2.  Implement the "Compliance Download" report generation API (using SSE) and frontend logic.
3.  Refine PDF formatting in the report generation API routes.
4.  Continue with Phase 7 tasks (Testing, CI/CD, etc.) once report features are complete.
5.  Address potential multiple file upload improvements.
