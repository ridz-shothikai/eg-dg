# Active Context: Layout Refactor & Guest Flow Implementation

**Date:** April 9, 2025 (Late Afternoon Update)

**Status:** Refactored Header and Sidebar into reusable components with conditional rendering based on authentication status and route. Implemented guest user workflow with local storage persistence and data association on signup. Adjusted loading spinner presentation.

**Recent Activity (April 9 - Afternoon):**
- **Layout Refactor:**
    - Created reusable `Header` component (`src/components/Header.js`) with conditional navigation links (Public vs. Authenticated-Public vs. Authenticated-Private).
    - Updated `Sidebar` component (`src/components/Sidebar.js`) to render only on authenticated, non-public routes.
    - Updated main layout (`src/app/layout.js`) to use the new `Header` and `Sidebar` components, removing duplicated code from individual pages.
    - Refactored static pages (`/`, `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources`) to remove inline header code.
    - Added logic to `Header` to fetch the first project ID for the "Dashboard" link when authenticated on public routes.
    - Fixed main content width issue on public pages by adjusting flex properties and adding `w-full` in `layout.js`.
- **Loading Spinner Adjustment:**
    - Modified `LoadingSpinner` component (`src/components/LoadingSpinner.js`) to accept a `size` prop.
    - Updated project detail page (`/project/[projectId]/page.js`) to center the main loading spinner and use a smaller size (`md`).
- **Landing Page Redesign:**
    - Replaced the previous root page (`/`) content with a new structure.
    - Implemented sections: Sticky Header, Hero (with guest upload), Core Features, Workflow, Use Cases, FAQ, Footer.
    - Removed "Social Proof" and "Pricing" sections.
    - Updated header navigation links.
    - Applied project's dark color scheme.
    - Used placeholders for assets.
- **Guest User Workflow:**
    - Implemented guest ID generation/storage (`localStorage`) on landing page upload.
    - Updated frontend (`/`, `/project/[id]`, `/signup`) to handle guest state, send `X-Guest-ID` header, display banner, and clear `guestId` on registration.
    - Updated backend models (`Project`, `Diagram`) with `guestOwnerId`/`guestUploaderId` fields.
    - Updated backend APIs (`/api/projects`, `/api/upload`, `/api/auth/register`, project-specific APIs) to handle guest creation, authorization via `X-Guest-ID`, and data association on registration.
- **New Pages Created:** Added placeholder pages for `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources`.
- **Layout Fix:** Resolved scrolling issue in `src/app/layout.js`.

**Previous Activity (April 9 - Morning/Dependencies):**
- **Dependency Updates:** Updated major dependencies (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4).
- **Docker Simplification:** Simplified `Dockerfile` and added `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Auth Route Updates:** Minor changes to `nextauth` and `register` routes.

**Current Focus:**
- Testing the layout changes (Header/Sidebar visibility) across different routes and authentication states.
- Verifying the complete guest user flow: upload -> dashboard access (guest mode) -> signup -> data association -> authenticated dashboard access.
- Testing core features (reports, chat) in both authenticated and guest modes.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Thoroughly test the guest user flow and the conditional layout rendering.
2.  Begin populating content for the `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, and `/resources` pages.
3.  Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons) when available.
4.  Address any regressions from recent changes.
