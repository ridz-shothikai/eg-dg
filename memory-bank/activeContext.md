# Active Context: Layout Refactor & Guest Flow Implementation

**Date:** April 10, 2025 (Afternoon Update)

**Status:** Implemented robust multi-file handling and error reporting for chat and report generation APIs. Ensured all project files are loaded before Gemini interaction, or the process fails clearly. Added user-friendly error messages for GCS download failures and Gemini API errors.

**Recent Activity (April 10 - Afternoon):**
- **Multi-File & Error Handling Implementation:**
    - Modified Chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the chat request stops with a specific user-friendly error.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini stream processing (`generateContentStream`, `sendMessageStream`) to map technical errors (e.g., safety blocks, resource exhaustion, invalid content) to user-friendly messages sent via the stream.
    - Modified BoM Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/bom/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and BoM generation) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.
    - Modified Compliance Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/compliance/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and compliance analysis) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.
    - Modified OCR/PDR Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/ocr/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and PDR generation) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.

**Previous Activity (April 9 - Evening):**
- **Report Generation Refactor:**
- **Report Generation Refactor:**
    - Modified BoM, Compliance, and OCR/PDR API routes (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/...`) to remove Puppeteer dependency.
    - Implemented calls to external HTML-to-PDF API (`https://html-text-to-pdf.shothik.ai/convert`) in report routes.
    - Updated report routes to embed CSS styles within the HTML sent to the external API for professional PDF formatting.
    - Updated report routes to correctly parse the `public_url` from the external API response.
- **Guest Authorization Fix:**
    - Updated report API routes to accept `guestId` via query parameter as a fallback for the `X-Guest-ID` header.
    - Updated frontend project page (`/project/[projectId]/page.js`) report download handlers to append `guestId` query parameter when in guest mode, fixing `401` errors for guests.
- **Layout & UI Fixes:**
    - Resolved layout inconsistencies between landing page and other static pages by ensuring consistent use of a wrapping `<main>` tag with `container mx-auto`.
    - Fixed issues causing unwanted scrollbars/black bars on static pages by adjusting flexbox properties in `layout.js`.
    - Updated landing page (`/`) file upload area styling: made dashed border always visible (white color) and added background change on hover for inner area feedback.
- **Chat UI Refinements:**
    - Implemented dynamic width calculation for the chat input area in `ProjectDetailPage` (`page.js`), passing the width to `ChatInterface`. (Initial implementation + user refinement using `setInterval` for robustness and `resize` listener).
    - Implemented auto-scrolling for the chat history in `ChatInterface` (`ChatInterface.js`) on new messages.
    - Adjusted scrollbar styling in `ChatInterface` for a thinner, rounded appearance.
    - Adjusted `maxHeight` of the chat history container in `ChatInterface` for layout refinement.

**Previous Activity (April 9 - Afternoon):**
- **Layout Refactor:** Created reusable `Header` and `Sidebar` components with conditional rendering. Implemented guest user workflow basics (ID generation, storage, header). Adjusted loading spinner. Redesigned landing page structure. Created placeholder static pages.
- **Dependency Updates & Docker:** Updated major dependencies. Simplified Docker setup.

**Current Focus:**
- Verifying the fixes for report generation (both functionality and PDF styling).
- Confirming guest user report downloads work correctly.
- Testing landing page UI interactions (upload area hover/border).
- Testing chat UI functionality (dynamic width, auto-scroll, styling).

**Next Steps:**
1.  Thoroughly test report generation for authenticated and guest users.
2.  Test layout consistency across all static pages.
3.  Begin populating content for the `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, and `/resources` pages.
4.  Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons) when available.
5.  Address any regressions from recent changes.
