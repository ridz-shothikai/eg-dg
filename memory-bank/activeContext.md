# Active Context: Reliability & UI Polish

**Date:** April 11, 2025 (Mid-Morning)

**Status:** Implemented retry logic for external API calls (Gemini, PDF conversion). Fixed dashboard background color inconsistency. Previous guest upload enhancements and fixes remain.

**Recent Activity (April 11 - Mid-Morning):**
- **API Call Retry Mechanism:**
    - Created reusable `fetchWithRetry` helper in `src/lib/fetchUtils.js` for general fetch calls.
    - Created `generateContentWithRetry` and `generateContentStreamWithRetry` helpers in `src/lib/geminiUtils.js` for Gemini API calls.
    - Integrated `fetchWithRetry` into landing page (`src/app/page.js`) for project creation and file uploads.
    - Integrated `fetchWithRetry` into report routes (`bom`, `ocr`, `compliance`) for HTML-to-PDF API calls.
    - Integrated Gemini retry helpers (`generateContent...`) into report routes (`bom`, `ocr`, `compliance`), chat route (`chat`), upload route (`upload`), and prepare route (`prepare`).
    - Added SSE messages in report routes to indicate retry attempts.
- **Dashboard UI Fix:**
    - Applied consistent dark background (`bg-gray-900`) to the main container in `src/app/layout.js` and the content columns in `src/app/project/[projectId]/page.js`.
    - Adjusted `ChatInterface.js` background to match (`bg-gray-900`).
    - Fixed minor syntax errors introduced during previous edits.
- **Project File List UI:**
    - Changed filename text color to white (`text-white`) in `src/app/project/[projectId]/page.js` for better visibility.
- **Dependency Installation:**
    - Installed `@heroicons/react` package via npm to fix build error in `FileUpload.js`.
- **NEXTAUTH_URL Configuration:**
    - Updated `.env` file with `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://163.172.181.252:3001`.
    - Updated `Dockerfile` to accept `NEXTAUTH_URL` as build `ARG` and set it as `ENV`.

**Previous Activity (April 11 - Morning):**
- **Guest Multi-File Upload & Progress Bar:**
    - Modified landing page (`src/app/page.js`) file input to accept multiple files (`multiple` attribute).
    - Updated `handleGuestUpload` function in `src/app/page.js` to:
        - Create the guest project once.
        - Loop through selected files, calling `/api/upload` for each.
        - Track upload progress using a new state variable (`uploadStep`).
        - Display dynamic progress text during the multi-file upload stage.
    - Created new component `src/components/MultiStepProgressBar.js` to display upload steps ("Creating Project", "Uploading Files", "Preparing Workspace") and dynamic progress text.
    - Integrated `MultiStepProgressBar` into `src/app/page.js`, replacing the simple "Uploading..." text.
- **Guest File Sync Fix:**
    - Identified that the `/api/projects/[projectId]/sync-files` API call in `src/app/project/[projectId]/page.js` was missing the `X-Guest-ID` header for guest users.
    - Updated the `fetch` call within the `useEffect` hook in `src/app/project/[projectId]/page.js` to include the `headers` object (which already contains the conditional `X-Guest-ID`), resolving the 401 error for guests.
- **Report Detail Review:**
    - Reviewed prompts in BoM, OCR/PDR, and Compliance report API routes (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/...`).
    - Decided *not* to modify prompts to increase report length/detail at this time.

**Previous Activity (April 10 - Late Afternoon Update 3):**
- **Chat AI Identity Response:**
    - Modified Chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]/route.js`).
    - Updated the `contextText` sent to the Gemini model to include a specific instruction: If asked about its identity, creator, or LLM, the AI must respond *only* with "I am Designed to analyse the Engineering Document and Analyze them . and i am created by Shothik AI".

**Previous Activity (April 10 - Late Afternoon Update 2):**
- **Chat Multi-File Context Enhancement:**
    - Modified Chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]/route.js`) to address Gemini potentially losing context of multiple files.
    - Changed strategy: Instead of using `startChat` and `sendMessageStream`, the API now uses `generateContentStream` for *every* user message.
    - For each request, the API reconstructs the full conversation history and explicitly includes the `inlineData` for *all* project files along with the current user message.
    - This ensures the model receives the complete file context on every turn, potentially improving responses involving multiple documents, at the cost of larger requests.

**Previous Activity (April 10 - Late Afternoon):**
- **Default Project Creation:**
    - Modified `Sidebar.js` component.
    - Added logic within the `fetchProjects` function to check if the fetched project list is empty for an authenticated user.
    - If no projects exist, a new function `createAndRedirectToDefaultProject` is called.
    - This function POSTs to `/api/projects` to create "My First Project" and then redirects the user to the new project's page (`/project/[newProjectId]`).

**Previous Activity (April 10 - Afternoon):**
- **Multi-File & Error Handling Implementation:**
- **Multi-File & Error Handling Implementation:**
    - Modified Chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the chat request stops with a specific user-friendly error.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini stream processing (`generateContentStream`, `sendMessageStream`) to map technical errors (e.g., safety blocks, resource exhaustion, invalid content) to user-friendly messages sent via the stream.
    - Modified BoM Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/bom/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and BoM generation) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.
    - Modified Compliance Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/compliance/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and compliance analysis) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.
    - Modified OCR/PDR Report API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/ocr/route.js`):
        - Implemented "Fail Fast" logic for GCS file downloads. If any file fails, the SSE stream sends an error event and stops.
        - Added `try...catch` around Gemini calls (`callGemini` for OCR and PDR generation) to map technical errors to user-friendly messages sent via SSE.

**Previous Activity (April 9 - Evening):**
- **Report Generation Refactor:**
- **Report Generation Refactor:**
    - Modified BoM, Compliance, and OCR/PDR API routes (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/...`) to remove Puppeteer dependency.
    - Implemented calls to external HTML-to-PDF API (`https://html-text-to-pdf.shothik.ai/convert`) in report routes.
    - Updated report routes to embed CSS styles within the HTML sent to the external API for professional PDF formatting.
    - Updated report routes to correctly parse the `public_url` from the external API response.
- **Guest Authorization Fix:**
    - Updated report API routes to accept `guestId` via query parameter as a fallback for the `X-Guest-ID` header.
    - Updated frontend project page (`/project/[projectId]/page.js`) report download handlers to append `guestId` query parameter when in guest mode, fixing `401` errors for guests.
- **Layout & UI Fixes:**
    - Resolved layout inconsistencies between landing page and other static pages by ensuring consistent use of a wrapping `<main>` tag with `container mx-auto`.
    - Fixed issues causing unwanted scrollbars/black bars on static pages by adjusting flexbox properties in `layout.js`.
    - Updated landing page (`/`) file upload area styling: made dashed border always visible (white color) and added background change on hover for inner area feedback.
- **Chat UI Refinements:**
    - Implemented dynamic width calculation for the chat input area in `ProjectDetailPage` (`page.js`), passing the width to `ChatInterface`. (Initial implementation + user refinement using `setInterval` for robustness and `resize` listener).
    - Implemented auto-scrolling for the chat history in `ChatInterface` (`ChatInterface.js`) on new messages.
    - Adjusted scrollbar styling in `ChatInterface` for a thinner, rounded appearance.
    - Adjusted `maxHeight` of the chat history container in `ChatInterface` for layout refinement.

**Previous Activity (April 9 - Afternoon):**
- **Layout Refactor:** Created reusable `Header` and `Sidebar` components with conditional rendering. Implemented guest user workflow basics (ID generation, storage, header). Adjusted loading spinner. Redesigned landing page structure. Created placeholder static pages.
- **Dependency Updates & Docker:** Updated major dependencies. Simplified Docker setup.

**Current Focus:**
- Testing API retry mechanisms under simulated failure conditions (if possible).
- Verifying dashboard background consistency.
- Confirming filename visibility improvement.
- Testing guest multi-file upload functionality and progress bar display.
- Verifying the guest file sync fix.
- Confirming no regressions were introduced by recent changes.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Thorough testing of API retry logic (Gemini, PDF, Uploads).
2.  Verify dashboard background fix across different screen sizes/content lengths.
3.  Thoroughly test the guest multi-file upload flow.
4.  Verify the guest file sync now works without 401 errors after upload.
5.  Test report generation for authenticated and guest users (check for retry messages if errors occur).
6.  Test layout consistency across all static pages.
7.  Begin populating content for the `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, and `/resources` pages.
8.  Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons) when available.
