# Active Context: Vercel Deployment Fixes & Chat Streaming

**Date:** March 28, 2025

**Status:** Addressed Vercel deployment issues related to filesystem access and implemented chat response streaming.

**Recent Activity:**
- **Vercel Deployment Fixes:**
    - Identified and fixed `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/var/task/temp'` errors occurring in production builds on Vercel.
    - Modified API routes (`upload`, `sync-files`, `reports/ocr`, `reports/bom`, `reports/compliance`, `chat`) to use Vercel's writable `/tmp` directory instead of attempting to create `./temp`.
    - Refactored report generation (OCR, BoM, Compliance) and chat API routes to download required files directly from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) during execution, eliminating reliance on the ephemeral `/tmp` cache which caused "document has no pages" errors from Gemini.
    - Added missing GCS storage client initialization in the chat API route.
- **Chat Streaming Implementation:**
    - Modified the chat API route (`chat/[projectId]/route.js`) to use Gemini's streaming methods (`generateContentStream`/`sendMessageStream`) and return a `ReadableStream`.
    - Updated the frontend chat component (`project/[projectId]/page.js`) to handle the streaming response, read chunks, and update the UI incrementally for a real-time typing effect.
    - Ensured the full chat response is saved to the database after the stream completes.
- **UI Refinements (Chat):**
    - **Loading Indicator:** Updated the chat loading indicator in `project/[projectId]/page.js` to show only a zooming grey dot (using the existing `animate-zoom` class) within the message bubble, removing the separate avatar.
    - **Copy Button:** Added a copy icon button below each completed AI response bubble in the chat (`project/[projectId]/page.js`). Clicking the button copies the message text to the clipboard.

**Current Focus:**
- Verifying the stability of the Vercel deployment after the filesystem and streaming fixes.
- Testing chat streaming and report generation in the production environment.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Thoroughly test all core functionalities (upload, sync, reports, chat) on the deployed Vercel instance.
2.  Address any remaining UI inconsistencies or bugs.
3.  Refine PDF formatting in the report generation API routes.
4.  Continue with Phase 7 tasks (Testing, CI/CD, etc.) once current features are stable.
5.  Address potential multiple file upload improvements.
