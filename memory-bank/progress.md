# Progress: Shothik AI â€“ Doclyze

**Date:** March 28, 2025

**Current Status:** Addressed Vercel deployment issues (filesystem, Gemini errors). Implemented chat streaming and UI loading indicator update.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Home, Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection. Landing/Login page UI updated.
-   **File Handling (Vercel Compatibility):**
    -   GCS upload API (`/api/upload`) correctly saves a copy to Vercel's `/tmp` directory.
    -   Sync API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/sync-files`) correctly checks/downloads missing files from GCS to `/tmp`.
    -   Project Detail page triggers background sync on load.
    -   **Crucially:** Report generation and Chat APIs now download files directly from GCS during execution, avoiding reliance on the unreliable `/tmp` cache in serverless functions.
-   **Diagram Processing:**
    -   Google Cloud Vision OCR integration during upload (Note: Potential redundancy).
    -   Basic OCR, BoM, Compliance viewer pages (links removed from file cards).
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects, Sidebar display (with larger title), New Project modal.
-   **Chat:**
    -   Contextual chat UI on project page with independent scrolling.
    -   Backend API (`chat/[projectId]/route.js`) using Gemini 2.0 Flash, downloads files directly from GCS.
    -   **Streaming:** Backend streams Gemini response; frontend updates UI incrementally with an animated dot loading indicator.
    -   Chat history saving (full response) and loading.
    -   Markdown rendering for responses.
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR, BoM, Compliance):**
    -   "OCR Download", "BoM Download", "Compliance Download" buttons on project page.
    -   Backend API routes (`ocr/`, `bom/`, `compliance/`) implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    -   APIs now download files directly from GCS, perform OCR & specific report generation via Gemini, create PDF (`pdf-lib`), upload temporary PDF to GCS, send signed URL via SSE.
    -   Frontend handlers (`handleOcrDownload`, etc.) use `EventSource` for real-time status and opening PDF.
    -   Independent loading/status/error state management for each report button.
    -   Generic error messages shown to user for backend failures.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   Thorough testing of Vercel deployment (upload, sync, reports, chat streaming).
-   Refine PDF formatting for all reports.
-   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
-   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
-   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   Testing (Unit, Integration).
-   CI/CD setup.
-   UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   Deployment Preparation.
-   (Lower Priority) Full multiple file upload handling.
-   (Decision) Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices for all features.
-   (External) Implement mechanism to clean up temporary *report* files in GCS. (Local `/tmp` cleanup is less critical now).

**Known Issues:**
-   The `params` warning in Next.js API routes needs monitoring.
-   PDF report formatting is currently very basic.
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR (on upload) and Gemini OCR (for reports/chat).
-   Need a strategy for cleaning up temporary report PDFs generated in GCS `temp-reports/` folder.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed Vercel deployment fixes and chat streaming implementation. Focus now shifts to testing and stabilization (Phase 6/7).
