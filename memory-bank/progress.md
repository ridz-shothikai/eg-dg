# Progress: Engineering Insights

**Date:** April 11, 2025 (Mid-Morning)

**Current Status:** Implemented retry logic for external API calls (Gemini, PDF). Fixed dashboard background color inconsistency. Fixed filename visibility. Configured NEXTAUTH_URL. Previous guest upload enhancements and fixes remain functional.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas. Build process successful.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection.
-   **Onboarding:** If an authenticated user has no projects, a default project ("My First Project") is automatically created, and the user is redirected to it (`Sidebar.js`).
-   **Layout & Navigation:**
    -   Reusable `Header` component created with conditional navigation (Public vs. Auth-Public vs. Auth-Private). Includes "Dashboard" link to first project for logged-in users on public pages.
    -   `Sidebar` component updated to render only on authenticated, non-public routes.
    -   Main layout (`layout.js`) updated to use `Header` and `Sidebar` correctly; adjusted flex properties; **added consistent dark background (`bg-gray-900`)**.
    -   Duplicated header code removed from static pages.
    -   Scrolling behavior corrected.
-   **Landing Page & Static Pages:**
    -   New landing page (`/`) implemented with Hero (incl. guest upload with **retry logic**), Features, Workflow, Use Cases, FAQ sections. Structure made consistent with other static pages (using main container).
    -   Placeholder pages created for `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` with content structure and consistent layout.
    -   Consistent dark theme applied.
-   **Guest User Flow:**
    -   Guest upload integrated into landing page Hero section, now supports **multiple file selection**.
    -   `guestId` generated/stored/sent via `localStorage`.
    -   Backend models (`Project`, `Diagram`) updated with guest fields.
    -   Backend APIs handle guest creation (once per multi-upload), authorization (header/query param), and data association on registration.
    -   Project Dashboard (`/project/[projectId]`) handles guest state, displays banner, sends guest ID via query param for report downloads, and correctly triggers background file sync using guest auth header. **Consistent dark background applied**. **Filename text color fixed**.
    -   Signup page (`/signup`) handles `guestId` transfer and clearing.
-   **UI Components:**
    -   `LoadingSpinner` component updated to accept `size` prop.
    -   Project detail page uses centered, `md` size spinner for loading states. Login/Signup pages center forms correctly.
    -   Landing page upload area styling updated (always visible white dashed border, inner hover effect).
    -   `MultiStepProgressBar` component created and integrated into landing page guest upload, showing dynamic progress text.
    -   `FileUpload` component (`/project/[projectId]/upload`) updated to support **multiple file selection and individual progress bars**.
-   **File Handling:** GCS upload for diagrams (supports sequential uploads for guest multi-file). API direct downloads from GCS for chat. Background file sync API (`sync-files`) correctly handles guest authorization.
-   **Diagram Processing:** Google Cloud Vision OCR on upload. **Optional Gemini summary on upload now includes retry logic.**
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects (supports guest), Sidebar display, New Project modal.
-   **Chat:**
    -   Contextual chat UI (`ChatInterface.js`) with **consistent dark background**.
    -   Streaming responses from backend API (**stream initiation includes retry logic**).
    -   Chat history display.
    -   Guest access support.
    -   Dynamic width calculation for input area based on container size (`ProjectDetailPage` -> `ChatInterface`).
    -   Auto-scrolling of chat history on new messages (`ChatInterface.js`).
    -   Custom scrollbar styling (thin, rounded, custom colors) (`ChatInterface.js`).
    -   Adjusted chat history container height (`ChatInterface.js`).
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR, BoM, Compliance):** SSE implementation, Gemini analysis (**now uses full file context + retry logic**), HTML cleanup, External API PDF generation (**includes retry logic**), guest access support, professional PDF styling.
-   **Multi-File Handling & Error Reporting:**
    -   Chat and Report APIs load *all* project files from GCS before interacting with Gemini.
    -   Implemented "Fail Fast" on GCS download errors.
    -   Implemented robust error handling for Gemini API calls (now includes retries).
    -   Chat API sends *all* project files (`inlineData`) with *every* user message using `generateContentStream` (**stream initiation includes retry logic**). Added identity instruction.
-   **API Reliability:** Implemented retry logic (max 3 attempts, exponential backoff) for key external API calls (Gemini, PDF conversion) and frontend API calls during guest upload.
-   **Dependencies:** Added `@heroicons/react`.
-   **Configuration:** `NEXTAUTH_URL` configured in `.env` and `Dockerfile`.
-   **Git Configuration:** `.gitignore` updated.
-   **MCP Server Setup:** Perplexity MCP server configured.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   **Testing:**
    -   Thorough testing of **API retry logic** (Gemini, PDF, Uploads).
    -   Verification of **dashboard background fix**.
    -   Thorough testing of the **guest multi-file upload flow** and progress bar display.
    -   Thorough testing of the **project multi-file upload flow** and individual progress bars.
    -   Verification that the **guest file sync (`sync-files` API)** works without 401 errors after upload.
    -   Thorough testing of report generation (auth/guest, PDF styling, retry messages).
    -   Testing layout consistency across all static pages.
    -   Testing chat UI functionality (dynamic width, auto-scroll, styling, responsiveness).
    -   Testing Vercel deployment.
    -   Unit/Integration tests.
-   **Content Population:** Add real content to `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` pages.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons).
    -   Implement mobile responsiveness for header/navigation.
    -   General UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   **Features:**
    -   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
    -   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
    -   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   **Deployment:** CI/CD setup, Deployment Preparation.
-   **(Decision - April 11):** Decided **not** to increase report detail/length via prompt changes.
-   **(Decision):** Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices.
-   **(External):** Consider if temporary report files from external PDF API need cleanup (depends on API behavior).

**Known Issues:**
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR and Gemini OCR.
-   Placeholder content/assets used extensively on marketing pages.
-   Mobile navigation menu in Header needs implementation.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed API reliability improvements and UI polish. Focus remains on testing and content population (Phase 6/7).
