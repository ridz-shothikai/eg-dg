# Progress: Shothik AI â€“ Doclyze

**Date:** March 28, 2025

**Current Status:** Implemented OCR/PDR report generation with SSE feedback. Starting BoM report.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Home, Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection.
-   **File Handling & Caching:**
    -   GCS upload API (`/api/upload`).
    -   Upload API saves copy to local `/temp/` directory.
    -   Sync API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/sync-files`) downloads missing files from GCS to `/temp/`.
    -   Project Detail page triggers background sync on load.
-   **Diagram Processing:**
    -   Google Cloud Vision OCR integration during upload (Note: Potential redundancy).
    -   Basic OCR, BoM, Compliance viewer pages (redirect after upload).
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects, Sidebar display, New Project modal.
-   **Chat:**
    -   Contextual chat UI on project page with independent scrolling.
    -   Backend API using Gemini 2.0 Flash.
    -   Reads files from local `/temp/` cache using `inlineData`.
    -   Chat history saving and loading.
    -   Markdown rendering for responses.
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR):**
    -   "OCR Download", "BoM Download", "Compliance Download" buttons added to UI.
    -   Backend API route (`/api/projects/[projectId]/reports/ocr`) implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    -   API reads files from `/temp/` cache, performs OCR & PDR generation via Gemini (handling safety settings), creates PDF (`pdf-lib`), uploads temporary PDF to GCS, sends signed URL via SSE.
    -   Frontend handler (`handleOcrDownload`) uses `EventSource` to display real-time status updates on the button and opens the final PDF URL in a new tab.
    -   Generic error messages shown to user for backend failures.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   Implement BoM Download report generation (API & Frontend - likely using SSE).
-   Implement Compliance Download report generation (API & Frontend - likely using SSE).
-   Refine PDF formatting for all reports.
-   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
-   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
-   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   Testing (Unit, Integration).
-   CI/CD setup.
-   UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   Deployment Preparation.
-   (Lower Priority) Full multiple file upload handling.
-   (Decision) Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices for all features.
-   (External) Implement mechanism to clean up old files in `/temp/`.

**Known Issues:**
-   The `params` warning in Next.js API routes needs monitoring.
-   PDF report formatting is currently very basic.
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR (on upload) and Gemini OCR (for reports).
-   Local `/temp/` cache relies on filesystem persistence and needs an external cleanup mechanism.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed initial implementation of OCR/PDR report download. Moving to BoM report download next (Phase 4/7 overlap).
