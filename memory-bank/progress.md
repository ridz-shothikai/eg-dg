**What's Left to Build (Based on PRD):**
-   All subsequent phases (7).

**Immediate Next Steps:**
-   Begin implementing Phase 7 tasks (Testing (Unit, Integration), CI/CD, Polishing, UAT Support, Deployment Prep).

**Backend:**
-   (Potentially) Add more robust error handling and logging to the API routes.

**Known Issues:**
-   None (Project just started).
