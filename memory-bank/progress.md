-   Added `chatHistory` field to `Project` model.
-   Created Project Preparation API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/prepare`) to download files from GCS, upload to Gemini File API, update `geminiFileUri` in DB, and fetch chat history.
-   Updated Project Detail page (`/project/[projectId]`) to call `/prepare` endpoint, display chat history, and implement two-column layout.
-   Refactored Chat API (`/api/chat/[projectId]`) back to use `gemini-pro` with text-based context (OCR data) and save conversation history. (File API approach caused errors).

**What's Left to Build (Based on PRD):**
-   All subsequent phases (7).

**Immediate Next Steps:**
-   Begin implementing Phase 7 tasks (Testing (Unit, Integration), CI/CD, Polishing, UAT Support, Deployment Prep).

**Backend:**
-   (Potentially) Add more robust error handling and logging to the API routes.

**Known Issues:**
-   None (Project just started).
