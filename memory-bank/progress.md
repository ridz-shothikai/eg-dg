# Progress: Engineering Insights

**Date:** April 11, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Current Status:** Separated dashboard layout from main site layout. Implemented functional dashboard header with user dropdown. Added file download links, serial numbers, and text wrapping to file list. Fixed chat scrollbar styling. Restored public page header visibility. Implemented retry logic for external API calls (Gemini, PDF). Configured NEXTAUTH_URL. Guest upload enhancements and fixes remain functional.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas. Build process successful.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection.
-   **Onboarding:** If an authenticated user has no projects, a default project ("My First Project") is automatically created, and the user is redirected to it (`Sidebar.js`).
-   **Layout & Navigation:**
    -   **Dashboard Layout:** Separated layout using `src/app/dashboard` directory and `layout.js`. Includes persistent `Sidebar` and `DashboardHeader`.
    -   **Root Layout:** Simplified `src/app/layout.js` to mainly include `AuthProvider` and `<Header>`.
    -   **Header Component:** Updated `Header.js` to hide itself on `/dashboard/...` routes, restoring visibility on public pages. Links updated to `/dashboard/...`.
    -   **Dashboard Header Component:** Created `DashboardHeader.js` with user dropdown (Profile placeholder, Logout button).
    -   **Sidebar Component:** Updated links and redirects to use `/dashboard/...`.
    -   Scrolling behavior corrected.
-   **Landing Page & Static Pages:**
    -   New landing page (`/`) implemented with Hero (incl. guest upload with **retry logic** and redirect to `/dashboard/...`), Features, Workflow, Use Cases, FAQ sections. Structure made consistent with other static pages (using main container).
    -   Placeholder pages created for `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` with content structure and consistent layout.
    -   Consistent dark theme applied. Header visibility corrected.
-   **Guest User Flow:**
    -   Guest upload integrated into landing page Hero section, now supports **multiple file selection** and redirects to `/dashboard/...`.
    -   `guestId` generated/stored/sent via `localStorage`.
    -   Backend models (`Project`, `Diagram`) updated with guest fields.
    -   Backend APIs handle guest creation (once per multi-upload), authorization (header/query param), and data association on registration.
    -   Project Dashboard (`/dashboard/project/[projectId]`) handles guest state, displays banner, sends guest ID via query param for report downloads, and correctly triggers background file sync using guest auth header.
    -   Signup page (`/signup`) handles `guestId` transfer and clearing.
-   **UI Components:**
    -   `LoadingSpinner` component updated to accept `size` prop.
    -   Project detail page uses centered, `md` size spinner for loading states. Login/Signup pages center forms correctly.
    -   Landing page upload area styling updated (always visible white dashed border, inner hover effect).
    -   `MultiStepProgressBar` component created and integrated into landing page guest upload, showing dynamic progress text.
    -   `FileUpload` component (`/dashboard/project/[projectId]/upload`) updated to support **multiple file selection and individual progress bars**.
    -   **Dashboard File List:** Reordered sections. Added serial numbers, download icons (linked to `gcsUrl`), and text wrapping for filenames. List scrolls independently.
-   **File Handling:** GCS upload for diagrams (supports sequential uploads for guest multi-file). API direct downloads from GCS for chat. Background file sync API (`sync-files`) correctly handles guest authorization.
-   **Diagram Processing:** Google Cloud Vision OCR on upload. **Optional Gemini summary on upload now includes retry logic.**
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects (supports guest), Sidebar display, New Project modal. **Added rename and remove functionality with custom popups in the sidebar, including backend API handlers (PUT/DELETE) and GCS file cleanup.**
-   **UI Components:** **Implemented project name truncation to 20 characters in the sidebar.**
-   **Configuration:** **Corrected import path for `src/constants.js` in API routes.**
-   **Chat:**
    -   Contextual chat UI (`ChatInterface.js`) with **consistent dark background**.
    -   Streaming responses from backend API (**stream initiation includes retry logic**).
    -   Chat history display.
    -   Guest access support.
    -   Dynamic width calculation for input area based on container size (`ProjectDetailPage` -> `ChatInterface`).
    -   Auto-scrolling of chat history on new messages (`ChatInterface.js`).
    -   **Custom scrollbar styling applied via `globals.css` (fixed white bar).**
    -   Adjusted chat history container height (`ChatInterface.js`).
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR, BoM, Compliance):** SSE implementation, Gemini analysis (**now uses full file context + retry logic**), HTML cleanup, External API PDF generation (**includes retry logic**), guest access support, professional PDF styling.
-   **Multi-File Handling & Error Reporting:**
    -   Chat and Report APIs load *all* project files from GCS before interacting with Gemini.
    -   Implemented "Fail Fast" on GCS download errors.
    -   Implemented robust error handling for Gemini API calls (now includes retries).
    -   Chat API sends *all* project files (`inlineData`) with *every* user message using `generateContentStream` (**stream initiation includes retry logic**). Added identity instruction.
-   **API Reliability:** Implemented retry logic (max 3 attempts, exponential backoff) for key external API calls (Gemini, PDF conversion) and frontend API calls during guest upload.
-   **Dependencies:** Added `@heroicons/react`.
-   **Configuration:** `NEXTAUTH_URL` configured in `.env` and `Dockerfile`.
-   **Git Configuration:** `.gitignore` updated.
-   **MCP Server Setup:** Perplexity MCP server configured.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   **Testing:**
    -   Verify dashboard layout separation and new header functionality.
    -   Test file list enhancements (serial numbers, download links, text wrapping, scrolling).
    -   Test header visibility on public vs. dashboard pages.
    -   Confirm chat scrollbar styling.
    -   Test API retry mechanisms.
    -   Test guest multi-file upload flow and redirects to `/dashboard/...`.
    -   Test report generation (auth/guest).
    -   Unit/Integration tests.
-   **Content Population:** Add real content to `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` pages.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   Refine dashboard UI/UX (e.g., header content - add project name?, sidebar styling, card styling for sections).
    -   Implement profile page functionality (or remove placeholder link in header dropdown).
    -   Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons).
    -   Implement mobile responsiveness for header/navigation.
    -   General UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   **Features:**
    -   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
    -   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
    -   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   **Deployment:** CI/CD setup, Deployment Preparation.
-   **(Decision - April 11):** Decided **not** to increase report detail/length via prompt changes.
-   **(Decision):** Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices.
-   **(External):** Consider if temporary report files from external PDF API need cleanup (depends on API behavior).

**Known Issues:**
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR and Gemini OCR.
-   Placeholder content/assets used extensively on marketing pages.
-   Mobile navigation menu in Header needs implementation.
-   Profile link in DashboardHeader dropdown is a placeholder.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed dashboard layout separation, header implementation, and file list enhancements. Focus shifts to testing and further UI refinement.
