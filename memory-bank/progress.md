# Progress: Engineering Diagram Insights

**Date:** April 9, 2025 (Late Afternoon Update 3)

**Current Status:** Refactored Header/Sidebar layout for conditional rendering. Implemented guest user workflow. Adjusted loading spinner presentation and fixed layout width issues. Created placeholder static pages. Landing page overhauled.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas. Build process successful.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection.
-   **Layout & Navigation:**
    -   Reusable `Header` component created with conditional navigation (Public vs. Auth-Public vs. Auth-Private). Includes "Dashboard" link to first project for logged-in users on public pages.
    -   `Sidebar` component updated to render only on authenticated, non-public routes.
    -   Main layout (`layout.js`) updated to use `Header` and `Sidebar` correctly; adjusted flex properties to fix content width on public pages.
    -   Duplicated header code removed from static pages.
    -   Scrolling behavior corrected.
-   **Landing Page & Static Pages:**
    -   New landing page (`/`) implemented with Hero (incl. guest upload), Features, Workflow, Use Cases, FAQ sections.
    -   Placeholder pages created for `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` with content structure and consistent layout.
    -   Consistent dark theme applied.
-   **Guest User Flow:**
    -   Guest upload integrated into landing page Hero section.
    -   `guestId` generated/stored/sent via `localStorage` and `X-Guest-ID` header.
    -   Backend models (`Project`, `Diagram`) updated with guest fields.
    -   Backend APIs handle guest creation, authorization, and data association on registration.
    -   Project Dashboard (`/project/[projectId]`) handles guest state, displays banner, sends header.
    -   Signup page (`/signup`) handles `guestId` transfer and clearing.
-   **UI Components:**
    -   `LoadingSpinner` component updated to accept `size` prop.
    -   Project detail page uses centered, `md` size spinner for loading states. Login/Signup pages center forms correctly.
-   **File Handling (Vercel Compatibility):** GCS upload, API direct downloads from GCS for chat/reports.
-   **Diagram Processing:** Google Cloud Vision OCR on upload.
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects (supports guest), Sidebar display, New Project modal.
-   **Chat:** Contextual chat UI, streaming responses, history, guest access support.
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR, BoM, Compliance):** SSE implementation, direct GCS downloads, Gemini analysis, HTML cleanup, Puppeteer PDF generation (Alpine Linux config), guest access support.
-   **Git Configuration:** `.gitignore` updated.
-   **MCP Server Setup:** Perplexity MCP server configured.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   **Testing:**
    -   Thorough testing of conditional Header/Sidebar rendering and layout fixes.
    -   Thorough testing of the complete guest user flow.
    -   Testing core features (reports, chat) in both authenticated and guest modes.
    -   Testing Vercel deployment.
    -   Unit/Integration tests.
-   **Content Population:** Add real content to `/solutions`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`, `/resources` pages.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   Replace placeholder assets (logo, icons).
    -   Refine PDF formatting/styling for all reports.
    -   Implement mobile responsiveness for header/navigation.
    -   General UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   **Features:**
    -   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
    -   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
    -   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   **Deployment:** CI/CD setup, Deployment Preparation.
-   **(Lower Priority):** Full multiple file upload handling.
-   **(Decision):** Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices.
-   **(External):** Implement mechanism to clean up temporary *report* files in GCS.

**Known Issues:**
-   PDF report formatting is basic.
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR and Gemini OCR.
-   Need strategy for cleaning up temporary report PDFs in GCS `temp-reports/`.
-   Placeholder content/assets used extensively on marketing pages.
-   Mobile navigation menu in Header needs implementation.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed layout refactor and guest flow. Focus shifts to testing and content population (Phase 6/7).
