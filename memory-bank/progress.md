# Progress: Engineering Diagram Insights

**Date:** March 30, 2025

**Current Status:** Resolved build errors caused by a syntax issue (missing brace) in the BoM report route. Previous fixes for PDF report generation (Puppeteer environment handling, Gemini HTML cleanup) and API route parameter handling are confirmed stable. Build is successful.

**What Works:**
-   **Core Setup:** Project structure, Memory Bank, basic pages (Home, Auth, Upload), styling, DB schemas. Build process successful.
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth integration, registration, login, logout, session management, page protection. Landing/Login page UI updated.
-   **File Handling (Vercel Compatibility):**
    -   GCS upload API (`/api/upload`) correctly saves a copy to Vercel's `/tmp` directory.
    -   Sync API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/sync-files`) correctly checks/downloads missing files from GCS to `/tmp`. Parameter handling error resolved using `await request.text()` workaround.
    -   Project Detail page triggers background sync on load.
    -   **Crucially:** Report generation and Chat APIs now download files directly from GCS during execution, avoiding reliance on the unreliable `/tmp` cache in serverless functions.
-   **Diagram Processing:**
    -   Google Cloud Vision OCR integration during upload (Note: Potential redundancy).
    -   Basic OCR, BoM, Compliance viewer pages (links removed from file cards).
-   **Project Management:** API for creating/fetching projects, Sidebar display (with larger title), New Project modal.
-   **Chat:**
    -   Contextual chat UI on project page with independent scrolling.
    -   Backend API (`chat/[projectId]/route.js`) using Gemini 2.0 Flash, downloads files directly from GCS.
    -   **Streaming:** Backend streams Gemini response; frontend updates UI incrementally with an animated dot loading indicator.
    -   Chat history saving (full response) and loading.
    -   Markdown rendering for responses.
-   **Report Generation (OCR/PDR, BoM, Compliance):**
    -   "OCR Download", "BoM Download", "Compliance Download" buttons on project page.
    -   Backend API routes (`ocr/`, `bom/`, `compliance/`) implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Build errors resolved.
    -   APIs now download files directly from GCS, perform OCR & specific report generation via Gemini.
    -   **Gemini HTML Cleanup:** Extraneous Markdown code fences (` ```html `) are removed from Gemini's HTML output before PDF creation.
    -   **PDF Creation (Puppeteer on Alpine Linux / Codespace):** Successfully troubleshooted and configured Puppeteer for the Alpine Linux environment.
        -   Identified the environment as Alpine Linux.
        -   Installed `chromium` and necessary system dependencies via `apk`.
        -   Configured the project to use `puppeteer-core` (via `package.json`).
        -   Updated report generation code (`ocr/route.js`) to launch Puppeteer using the system-installed Chromium (`/usr/bin/chromium-browser`) with appropriate launch arguments (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-setuid-sandbox`).
        -   Verified the setup using a test script (`test-browser.js`).
    -   Temporary PDF uploaded to GCS, signed URL sent via SSE.
    -   Frontend handlers (`handleOcrDownload`, etc.) use `EventSource` for real-time status and opening PDF.
    -   Independent loading/status/error state management for each report button.
    -   Generic error messages shown to user for backend failures.
-   **Git Configuration:** `.gitignore` updated to exclude problematic paths (`NUL`, external repo).
-   **MCP Server Setup:** Successfully installed and configured the Perplexity MCP server (`github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp`) for enhanced research capabilities.

**What's Left to Build (High Level):**
-   Thorough testing of Vercel deployment (upload, sync, reports, chat streaming).
-   Refine PDF formatting/styling for all reports.
-   Implement Diagram Comparison feature.
-   Implement Knowledge Hub search functionality.
-   Implement Admin Panel functionalities.
-   Testing (Unit, Integration).
-   CI/CD setup.
-   UI Polishing & UAT Support.
-   Deployment Preparation.
-   (Lower Priority) Full multiple file upload handling.
-   (Decision) Clarify if Google Vision OCR is still needed or if Gemini OCR suffices for all features.
-   (External) Implement mechanism to clean up temporary *report* files in GCS.

**Known Issues:**
-   PDF report formatting is currently very basic.
-   Potential redundancy between Google Vision OCR (on upload) and Gemini OCR (for reports/chat).
-   Need a strategy for cleaning up temporary report PDFs generated in GCS `temp-reports/` folder.

**Development Plan Phase:** Completed build error fixes and report generation stabilization. Focus remains on testing and stabilization (Phase 6/7).
